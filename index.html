             <p> <b> Interesting fact about Karaganda </b> </p>
             <br>In the 1940s up to 70% of the city's inhabitants were ethnic Germans. Most of the ethnic Germans were Soviet </br>
             Germans who were collectively deported to Siberia and Kazakhstan on Stalin's order when Hitler 
             <br>invaded Soviet-annexed eastern Poland and the Soviet Union proper in 1941. 
             Until the 1950s, many of these deportees were interned in labor camps,</br>
             often simply because they were of German descent. The population of Karaganda fell by 14% from 1989 to 1999 
             <br>following the dissolution of the Soviet Union; 
             it was once Kazakhstan's second-largest city after Almaty. </br>
             Over 100,000 people have since emigrated to Germany. There is also a concentration of ethnic Poles in 
             the city.
